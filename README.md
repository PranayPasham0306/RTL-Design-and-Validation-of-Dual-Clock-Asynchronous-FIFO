# RTL-Design-and-Validation-of-Dual-Clock-Asynchronous-FIFO

 Designed a 32-bit wide asynchronous FIFO with a depth of 256, featuring Pessimistic Full and Empty flags
 Realized Gray Code Encoding and 2-flop Synchronizers to avoid Multi-bit Transitions and Metastability
 Validated with 40 MHz write and 30 MHz read clocks for a 512-burst input over 21.333 Âµs in ModelSim
